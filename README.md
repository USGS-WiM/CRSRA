# CRSRA

Connecting River Systems Restoration Assessment, part of the Great Lakes Coastal Wetlands Restoration Assessment (GLCWRA) Project.

The Connecting River Systems Restoration Assessment (CRSRA) model was co-developed by investigators in the Environmental Studies Program at the New College of Florida in Sarasota, Florida and the USGS - Great Lakes Science Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The web mapping application for interfacing with the CRSRA model was developed by developers on the Web Informatics and Mapping team.

The development of the CRSRA has been supported by the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes Landscape Conservation Cooperative and the University of Michigan Water Center.
